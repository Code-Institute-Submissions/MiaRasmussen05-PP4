# Portfolio Project Website

This website was created for my 4th Portfolio Project with Code Institute. I decided to create a website to promote my skills and what I do. By both having a gallery, shop, portfolio, and a blog I can use all the things I love and promote myself as well. I used the idea of a shop to reach a bussines point of view, because more and more people shop online so they can get everything from everywhere. With a blog that takes a more of a social network point of view so conversation can be made and discussions can get started. A gallery to see the beauty in the world througt someone elses eyes.
